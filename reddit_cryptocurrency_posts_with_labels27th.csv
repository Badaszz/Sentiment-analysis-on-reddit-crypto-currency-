Worst CEX in crypto,2023-12-23,75,0.83,"**Bilaxy** is the worst *CEX* in crypto. If you are considering trading there please listen to me and don't do it! It's driving me crazy! I can't **buy**, I can't **sell**. 

Every time I try to buy the price goes up, I try to adjust the buying price every time but somehow I can't buy because someone else sells it higher. It's as If I was the only person trading there. It's been days I can't sell my eth because somehow the price keeps falling lower and lower every time I try to sell 😂

**Stay away!** + Can't withdraw because of **high fees**. If I withdraw half of my eth will be Bilaxy fees (crazy). I just want to turn my eth into USDT and withdraw through Tron (5$ fees) but Bilaxy won't let me turn my eth into usdt! Probably because they want me to withdraw my ETH directly so they get half of my ETH in withdrawal fees. Fucking scammers.

**After some google research I found this article:**

Bilaxy do have a multitude of low cap coins but it is not worth it. Due to their liquidity issues you will always be buying and selling at a bad price (big spread). If that wasn't bad enough, sometimes Bilaxy would not fill the order completely and leave a portion that is below their minimum (their minimum to use). You cannot do anything with that money anymore. It is gone. Unlike Kucoin and Binance which give you the option to convert all the small change and residues of previous transactions into their local token and hence accumulate them, Bilaxy doesn't give you that option even though they do have their own token.

*UPDATE*: I finally sold at loss. Withdraw still processing though. I will let you know if I receive my funds.

*FINAL UPDATE*: Received the usdt. Lost 25% of my initial money. 🤡

*FINAL FINAL UPDATE:* After selling ocai at 0.8 and after being traded at 0.7-0.8 for days, now OCAI (literally 1h after I sold) is trading at 0.96 in Bilaxy 🤡🤡🤡 🐿️🐿️🐿️ FUCK OFFFF",-1

"All shilling aside, I believe Stacks (STX) is a great investment",2023-12-24,0,0.2,"Hi guys,

Last time I made a post regarding STX was around 3 months ago. I believe STX was sitting around $0.50. It is currently $1.50. 

I’m no guru or financial advisor, but I believe STX is a project that you should look into.

STX is the native token of the Stacks blockchain, a layer 2 blockchain network that leverages the security of the Bitcoin blockchain to settle transactions. Essentially, STX is a layer built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to expand the functionality of Bitcoin by enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications.

STX has a major upgrade that the dev team claims will be released prior to BTC halving. The upgrade (Nakamoto upgrade) adds important capabilities that enhance the power of Stacks as a Bitcoin layer. In addition to the trustless, two-way Bitcoin peg (sBTC), this release would enable transactions secured by Bitcoin finality and faster Stacks transactions between Bitcoin blocks.


A few notable reasons why I believe STX is a solid investment:

STX was the first project to have their ICO approved by the SEC ( https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1693656/000110465919039476/a18-15736_1ex1a13tstwtrsd10.htm )

STX gives you an opportunity to use your STX in a “Stacking” mechanism, which essentially lets you stake STX & receive BTC as rewards (return is currently around 10% APR)

Wrapping this up all together, STX has huge growth potential. I also believe that STX will be one of the coins to benefit drastically along with Bitcoin if/when a Bitcoin spot ETF is approved. And since STX is operating more like a layer 1, the sky is the limit as far as market cap. 

I am writing this only because as a cryptocurrency community, I believe it is beneficial to share our findings amongst each other. No one likes to hear someone shilling a project, but if you can recommend a project & the reasons why you believe it is a good project, then I for one am all ears & eager to hear about why you believe it is a good project.

I know a lot of people are going to assume I am making this post just to shill (that’s what happened last time), but regardless, if I can get someone interested to look into it further, I feel like I did well. STX is already at a $2.1 Billion MC, so obviously making this post does absolutely nothing for the price of STX.

As always, don’t take a strangers advice & DYOR. Also, if you have a coin that you recommend, I would love to hear what & why!

"In 2025, the hype around crypto will be massive (GTA 6 release date + 4 year bullcycle)",2023-12-23,0,0.38,"**Hype** is more ""valuable"" in crypto than the tech behind it.

Forget Play2Earn crypto games, they're still crappy and won't drive more customers in here yet.

But ""GTA 6"", a very popular game, will feature in-game crypto (not real crypto). GTA 6's release date is in 2025. This will expose crypto in a playful manner.

The markets are still choppy at the moment, but in 2025 the hype machinery will pump crypto everywhere.

People will compare 2021 bullrun with the bull in 2025.

I don't expect 2024 to be very bullish, because the market factored an ETF approval already. Also there is no excess liquidity which could pour into the markets, especially not in high risk assets such as crypto.

But 2025 will look completely diffent. If the FED manages to solve the inflation problem by then, we will have a great bullrun.

All fiat money is debt. Bitcoin is a possible flight to safety.,2023-12-27,0,0.46,"All money is debt in fiat systems. 

I can hear you muttering: ""Money is not debt. Money is money. Debt is debt. Invest in a dictionary.""

Do something for me. Take out a crisp $100 note. Hold it in the light. What's it worth? Is it worth $100? What if I told you it is technically not worth anything more than the material it's printed on?

It's worth $100 because we all agreed on it. The money we use is backed purely by our collective faith in it. This is called ""fiat money"". It is government-issued, has no tie to hard assets, and can be printed without restriction. 

Because our currency is not backed by a hard asset, it has no intrinsic value. And since it has no intrinsically-valuable commodity backing it, it is a form of credit - a claim on purchasing power that we promise to pay back. All fiat money is debt. 

If you're still confused, stick with me. Let's think about debt from first principles. Imagine I borrow money from you. This money becomes an asset for you, and a liability for me. It's a liability for me because I need to eventually pay that money back to you. Now in our current system, ***all*** **financial assets are liabilities that need to be paid back.** The money we have is an asset for us but a liability for our bank. Our bank's assets are a liability of the central bank. The central bank's assets are a liability of the government. And government assets are liabilities for taxpayers like you and me. And the cycle repeats. It's an infinite regress of liabilities. There is no hard asset at the core of our financial system - only claims upon claims upon claims.

Now contrast this to a hard financial asset like Bitcoin. When I own Bitcoin, it is an asset to me and a liability to no one else.

I know this sounds dumb but bear with me.

How do i stop myself from wanting to sell the moment i see 500% gains?




It’s consistently hard to pick a project because on paper some look a lot better than others but when i look at Matic or XRP their charts are vomit-inducing and definitely make my wallet run for the hills, so i have decided to put all my eggs in one basket in the nice little Solana universe with all it’s memecoins and suddenly free-of-outages network.",1
Bitcoin ETF Approval : what makes you think this would lead to a new bull run in crypto ?,2023-12-22,173,0.76,"It is almost looking like SEC is favoring the cash redemption model for potential approval of BTC spot ETF. Now, what makes you think that this would cause a new bull run in the crypto market.

Here are some of my thoughts 

1. There would be an easy way for individual investors to gain exposure to crypto but majority of folks who are already interested in the space are holding BTC on their wallets or buying through apps like coinbase / RH etc.
2. Given that this is a cash redemption model, this would discourage investors whose main purpose is to own BTC in their wallets (cold storage)
3. Institutional investors would not immediately enter the market as they are not comfortable owning asset like BTC which is highly volatile because the whales can move the market as per their wish.
4. In the cash redemption model, its the issuer (via custodian) that would ultimately be holding BTC on their balance sheet. Isn't this going to cause more concentrated positions at fewer entities ?
5. Till now whales were able to manipulate the price as they held large positions but with as more people start taking a position this would lead to better price discovery and liquidity and we might even see lower prices ?

And finally even if all the above points are negated and there is a good possibility of new investors buying spot BTC etf just like gold or real estate etfs, what makes you think this is not already priced in ?

- Removed a google-loaded library (made network calls, could track users)

- Removed currencies network call, now loads currency list locally

- Removed icons from currency list. The icons got loaded from internet servers. Could be used to track users

- Removed braze. Whatever the fk that may be. It was making network calls

- Removed asset balance summary. Made network calls involving asset balances (no no no no).

Looking for a DAO maker tool that allows users to create ETF style funds,2023-12-22,0,0.33,"I'm looking for some DAO tooling that would allow me to create a sort of index fund. Do you know any?

Heres how it would work:  


The DAO would weight different assets (ie, 30% USDC, 10% wBTC, 10% ETH, 10% CRV, 10 AAVE, 30% SHIB as an example). This would be static and it wouldn't rebalance.  


When a user then sends funds to the DAO contract, it would automatically acquire the assets per the weights the DAO has chosen.  


The user would then get a DAOTOKEN back. This would potentially provide governance rights - ie, to propose different weights or different assets etc.  


When sending the DAOToken back to the DAO contract, ie redemption, the DAO would automatically liquidate a corresponding portion of the funds and return stablecoins back to the user.   


Its similar to Indexed in certain ways, except that the DAO would be able to choose the tokens to include in the index so to speak.  


Any ideas or projects doing something similar id be very happy to know about.

I understand that bETH is a wrapped token representing the equal value of the token but not actually my original token and that the wrapping was done through a now dead protocol or smart contract. The wallet appears to be able to still connect to Anchor but nothing can be done on it. It looks like it needs to be unwrapped before being bridged back through the wormhole but I'm not sure if I can unwrap at this point.",1

For those who had crypto stolen in the past and tried to recover it: what happened next?,2023-12-21,70,0.87,"Feels like we've been seeing more posts recently where people fall victim to scams and hacks.  Not looking to open up old wounds here, but I feel like we never hear of the aftermath unless the hack happened to a large company that had a lot of resources to throw at it.  

I realize that something like this happening to an individual would probably turn them off from crypto, so there might not be too many victims of thefts that continue to read this subreddit.  But I would love to hear some updated stories of anybody willing to share, and maybe get some hope (or maybe a painful reality check) for others currently going through something similar.

Has anyone out there been able to partially or fully recover their crypto or cash equivalent?  Or have most people hit dead ends?  What routes did you try (law enforcement, private investigators, white-hat hackers, etc.), and were any particularly helpful?",1
PSA: Don't trade futures if you're in a country that doesn't allow it.,2023-12-26,40,0.74,"I've been seeing a few comments and posts about frozen assets and ''return of lost assets'' (meaning they take all the profits you made from all your trades) from users of Mexc and bitrue. At first it was concerning but after looking into it deeper it seemed to be people trading futures while in a country that doesnt allow this. This is actually a step towards adoption if the CEX is abiding by local regulations so should be celebrated in a way. Just sucks for those people that lost the profits they made or had their account frozen. So going forward, if you're trading futures, make sure you're allowed to in your country. Don't think that a VPN will save you either, that in itself can flag up a concern for the CEX. Stay safe and abide by the rules peeps.",1

Update: FixedFloat returned my money,2023-12-27,593,0.99,"My last post was regarding FixedFloat freezing my exchange as they flagged it as fraudulent. This happened right before Christmas and had me panicking hard! 

They had asked for evidence of where the monies came from and gave me a list of transactions I had to verify and explain. After a lot of back and forth they agree’d to refund or continue with my exchange. 

I think it’s important to share these experiences with the community so others are aware these things can happen. If I was unable to show evidence of the transactions then 30K would just vanish.

Bitcoin / crypto future and thought,2023-12-23,0,0.36,"Hello reddit, I have some thoughts/arguments that I would like to hear your respons on. Thanks for reading / Coursell

**Cryptocurrencies intrinsic value:**

Crypto currencies does not have an intrinsic value. Meaning, You cannot use a bitcoin for anything except exchanging it with another person. It is the same as a useless piece of plastic that has an amount limit and you can throw it instantly to everyone around the world. Does it make you want the plastic piece? Well not me.

This is why Crypto can't be compared to gold since gold have a intrinsic value. you can make jewelry and electronics with gold that people are ready to pay for.

**Other cryptos vs Bitcoin**

Well, is there is a plastic piece that you can throw to other people easier then at least you would prefer using that piece of plastic instead of the old clumpy plastic piece you used before right? That's old Cryptos(Bitcoin, ether, etc) vs new ones (maybe Solana, bitcoin SV, ripple etc).

With this theory an crypto currency will eventually always go to zero since there will always come new crypto currencies that are better for trading.

**BUT Bitcoin can have an intrinsic value!!??**

Just like an old painting from 1822, people don't pay millions because it is more beautiful than a painting today. They millions because there are enthusiasts out there that feel great having that rare piece.

Just like the painting, I believe Bitcoin is the crypto currency that can have this kind of intrinsic value. Just because there are enthusiasts that want to have bitcoin because it was the first crypto.

**If Bitcoin have intrinsic value, then it can be used for trading/money storage forever**

If Bitcoin can have that intrinsic value then the value will never go to zero and eventually stabilize. And with a stabilized crypto that never goes to zero you can store your money safely and trade.

But since it is such an ineffective currency with long transaction times and high transaction fees it can never be used for day to day things. It will remain for money storage with few transactions",1

Creating a 12-word seed on a hardware wallet that defaults to 24 words (eg titan 2.0),2023-12-23,0,0.5,"By default, many hardware wallets create 24 word seeds. The private key entropy is 128 bits and therefore 12 words are sufficient security. 12 words are also easier to memorize compared to 24 words. The only advantage of 24 words is that if you can verify them reordered for example on trezor. However, if you already have a 12 word seed, you can recover it on most hardware wallets including ellipal.

I wouldn't use the reordered seed word features anyway because I do not want even a single word from my seed touching any computer. I also think memorizing the key adds to safety. You can still split your seed phrase into 4 different pieces and hide them in 4 different places. what is ""elite dwarf energy"" written on a piece of paper in my bank locker? well its 1/4 of my seed. If someone sees it, they may not even know wtf it is. I would only need to access them if I forget my seed plus I forgot my passphrase or lost my h/w wallet.

The way to create a new 12-word-seed is simple: get a dice and a coin and follow instructions here:

[https://github.com/taelfrinn/Bip39-diceware](https://github.com/taelfrinn/Bip39-diceware)

This should give you 12 words, the problem is that the last word has checksum bits that need to be correct. You can try 16 sequential words and one of them should fit. If you have an air-gapped computer, you can get the last word using this:

[https://github.com/bharathrao/bip39check](https://github.com/bharathrao/bip39check)

To memorize your 12 word seed, say the first 4 words the first day, every hour; the first 8 words the next day and the full seed on the 3rd day. Verify every week. You will never forget it.

Good luck.",1

They open an account and see on the trading platform BTC is worth $4,000. But there is a website that is more up to the second that shows BTC is now at $4,100.

The marketing (and children playing around with memes and cartoon NFTs) is the only reason it has a 50bn mcap, not real world utility. It's an orchestrated campaign by influential people early in the bull cycle to drum up exit liquidity from retail. They will find another shiny new coin to shill once they have dumped on mass. No coincidence that the pump has come so early as they look to claw back losses/get a good exit. The chain is probably just about fit for purpose for kids doing their meme trades but not for big players. They want reliability. And before you say 'Visa is partnered', it's a pilot to potentially offer USDC on Solana.

Read Eth Zurich's report recently issued. The tech is fundamentally flawed, as is their proof of history consensus. This verdict is from the brightest people in the space. Not 16 year old moonboys and influencers.

"12 years, 200,000,000 transactions, 100% uptime. LTC has realized its digital silver aspiration.",2023-12-22,189,0.79,"It took Litecoin 10 years to reach 100,000,000 transactions. No fancy smart contract operations, no yield farming, mostly just real money transfers and purchases. It took less than 2 years to get the second 100,000,000 transactions. And while omnilite nfts and L'Ordinals have contributed more recently, litecoin probably has about 1/5th the ordinals that BTC has and is still recently exceeding daily BTC transactions repeatedly in recent days. So it's still mostly a medium of transaction story playing out.

Onchain transactions don't tell the whole story. We've all seen chains either 1) completely fake onchain transactions 2) unsustainable incentivize sorta real activity that collapses once the incentives dry up. So it's important to compare onchain data to offchain data to see if they match. Faking things onchain is cheap, just pay small tx fees. 

Conversely, faking data at bitpay is not so cheap. You actually have to buy stuff. You're out the fees, and the cost of the items, shipping. Perhaps that's why no altcoin in history every took the number one slot on bitpay until this year. Because it had to happen for real. Which altcoin did it twice this year, first this summer and then last month? And was also the first altcoin to exceed the share of every other altcoin on the platform? **Litecoin**.

&#x200B;

[Bitpay stats for July-Nov 2023 available at bitpay dot com slash stats](https://preview.redd.it/9nb70f0n4w7c1.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9b06fbb339a881c4f0510ddebcda11ed78c5416)

Bitpay is the oldest largest crypto payments processor I know of, going back to 2011. It's often behind the addition of retailers and infrastructure that makes the news, like Roblox, AMC (including recent Taylor Swift ticketing news) and Newegg, once upon a time, even Steam. They were behind crypto integration with point of sale provider verifone who does 14 billion fiat transactions a year. 

As recently as 2020, bitpay stats held Bitcoin at 90% of their transaction share. They added litecoin in 2021 and things changed fast. It hit #2 in 3 months and only ever left the number 2 spot to occasional steal the number 1 slot from the king. It's okay, bitcoin, you still win store of value, and this is why digital silver exists, to help on the transactional side.

But don't just look at one outlet, of course. It'd be nice if all info were consolidated, but it isn't. So you have to look around. Litecoin has always been early to big exchanges and is supported about as broadly as eth and btc there and at other infrastructure. In one infrastructure case, coin atms, we know share numbers thanks to coinatmradar. Wouldn't you know it, the second most popular coin looks familiar. 

&#x200B;

[coinatmradar global stats](https://preview.redd.it/robjhoz19w7c1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5951562fc30200b94d2669f3b4026d9f3123aed2)

The closest I've found to a global scorecard of infrastructure usage is kaiko liquidity. Bear in mind that liquidity ranking usually tilt toward fiat values, so if a lower mcap coin is scoring top 5 alongside coins with mcaps multiple times higher, the reality of its advantage is being massively understated. In Q3, the most recent report I can find, Litecoin is outscoring most of the top ten mcap coins in liquidity. 

&#x200B;

[Kaiko Liquidity Ranking Q3](https://preview.redd.it/5i720s48aw7c1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b77f2d9172b5245eaa6e422acf7b539a2d5339ce)

Those are ordered by mcap, but you see the liquidity score in orange. It's a good indication that litecoin's infrastructure advantage hasn't been priced in by the investor class. That right now, litecoin's adoption is mostly coming from real world users more than traders. It's one of the things I love about it. My strategy is to buy unpriced network effects, and there aren't many of those to be found in crypto. Usually investors buy future network effects at a premium, hoping users will come eventually. Rarely do so many users coalesce w/o an investor pile-on.

All that to say this, yeah, those 200,000,000 transactions are the real deal. As is the 12 year 100% uptime that is unique to litecoin alone. Even Bitcoin's uninterrupted uptime is only just over 10 years. Litecoin has fulfilled the role it aspired to in the early days, to become digital silver.

Are Bitcoin spot ETFs really an institutional adoption?,2023-12-25,53,0.73,"I keep hearing people using the ETFs approval as some kind of an unprecedent example of institutional adoption of BTC, but is that really the case.

There is  a very important distinction in most peoples statement on this subreddit, that many are wrong about but keep repeating it as truth.  The wealthiest fund managers like Blackrock are not adopting Bitcoin, they are simply opening and accommodating an additional channel for those that want to adopt Bitcoin as an investment.

If I was going to compare the approval of ETF to anything more common, I would have to say that its like a big box store, taking a chance on brining in a niche product and hoping they will have a lot of sales. They themselves are not using that product in their store but simply make it more accessible to those that want it. Saying that, there is no way to guarantee that the product will be an instant success and will fly off the shelves, does it? Things get discontinued from big box store all the time.

That is a very big difference and that is also a reason why the existing Bitcoin ETFs in Canada and Europe are not doing anywhere close to the amount of business everyone projects the new channel should bring. Bitcoin has now been around for 15 years. Its not a new thing by any measures. Its not hard to get at all anymore, since setting up an online crypto brokerage account in US or Europe and funding it take minutes now and not weeks like it did when I bought my first Bitcoin in 2017.

I won't even go to the narrative that both banks and governments have been heavily pushing for a decade now that crypto currencies are nothing more then methods of payment for criminals and terrorist. If you think, people will just forget about that and start piling into the most risky investment on the planet, with a history of collapsing in value by 75-85% on a regular basis, you are all out of your mind.

It really reminds me of the Coinbase listing on stock exchange. It was hailed as the moment the financial markets recognized that crypto exchanges are an legitimate businesses and have a place along stock markets and other financial exchanges. The results were no where near the hyped numbers projected to come into the crypto space and ETFs will turn out the be exactly the same. It will help bring in some additional funds, that otherwise would not come in, but it will be far from revolutionary and earth shattering as many are making it to be.

After all Blackrock or any other institution, currently applying for Bitcoin ETFs, has not committed to put any of its existing funds under management into the crypto ETFs but simply offer another channel for those that might want to use it, outside already available means of crypto exchanges. There is a reason why most popular Canadian and European Bitcoin Spot ETFs are just around 2 billion of dollars under management each and not more then that. By the way most of the growth in those ETFs came from recent price increase of Bitcoin itself and not some wide spread adoption of investors.",1

2) SAM'S COIN. Heavily tied to Sam Bankman Fried, the market maker noted above I presume. Well, SBF is a convicted fraudster and will face a possible lifetime sentence. 

3) They claim decentralisation and yet Solana's current size is 200TB. You need to be a nation state or a super large institution in order to run a full node. 

4) At least 60% of Solana's transactions are failed transactions. 

5) A fundamentally broken chain. The consensus just doesn't work. The founder Toly even dared saying that consensus mechanism is not important, only hardwares matter. Most of Solana's history is hosted on AWS. Can it even be called a decentralized blockchain at this point. For me personally, if Solana is a decentralized blockchain, then so is Google. 

6) Solana has an on/off button. This is literally a big no no. A dozen outages since inception. 

7) And now BONK and Solana Mobile Saga. Originally, the price for a Solana mobile was $1000. Then it was cut  down to as low as $600. But they put BONK inside  Solana Mobile Saga. Artificially pumped the price of BONK. Then people rushed buying Saga. The price of SOL token then pumped too as a result. This is literally securities fraud at its best. 

The list goes on and on. Here are resources for you to find those details:

"Bitcoin, Microstrategy and Miners",2023-12-24,2,0.56,"MSTR borrows money at 0% interest and buys BTC every quarter. When companies like MSTR buy and HODL, the price usually goes up.

1. BTCs Spiral: When price goes up, MSTR share price goes up. When share price goes up, unrealized gain goes up, No margin call at all - instead MSTR borrows more money and buys Bitcoin. Bitcoin price goes up.  This is like a spiral that can end up in an exponential function. 


2. Miners are  selling everyday: Only reason BTC isn't going exponential is because miners are selling daily at Spot price. Miners are now  making 2X the amount as compared to what they made a year back. Why would they not sell and make 2X revenue? That's why miners stock price goes 3X when BTC price goes 2X.


Conclusion: Companies like MSTR and Mining company stocks make you more money that BTC itself if you can buy at the start of bull run. 

If there is sudden price drop, Companies like MSTR and Mining companies plunge more than price of BTC itself.",1
Obscuring any ERC-20 token in any wallet. Possibility for whales to hide themselves. Thoughts?,2023-12-23,16,0.78,"Oasis's new EVM Sapphire makes it possible to wrap any ERC-20 token in a privacy wrapper. Which besides granting other features it also grants the ability to not have the token show up in your wallet. 

So someone from some tiny project on another EVM could theoretically bridge their token to Sapphire, wrap it and then no one would know that specific wallet is a whale. As the wallet won't even show up in the explorer as a whale wallet. 

This can happen as soon as Sapphires first DEX launches in about 2 weeks or so.

Trying to understand the Solana hate. Where do you stand?,2023-12-21,188,0.66,"I've been lurking for a while and still haven't figured out if the Solana hate is something of the past or if there's still genuine disdain from the whole Reddit community.

I know that most of it stems from past chain outages but looking into other players (eth for example) that's not something exclusive to Solana. Many other chains have experienced similar network issues without facing the same level of backlash.

Once you get past the noise, Solana seems to be in better shape than other top 10 chains. Solana Pay, Institutional partnerships, gaming, chain speed, hackathons everywhere, etc. - these are all growth indicators that Polygon, Avalanche, Tron, and others promised to deliver on and failed. Imo Solana seems to be in a good direction and deserves the growth it has seen these last few months.

Have you recovered money lost in rugpulls yet?,2023-12-24,66,0.74,"In the 2021 bull run, a lot of us decided to take extra risks and get into projects that promised ridiculously high returns. A lot of them were shilled on YouTube and marketed as safe. In this case, I don't mean rugpull in the strictest sense, it can also be a token with really poor tokenomics (to the point that they inevitably lead to collapse, and the devs know it). 

I checked my Metamask wallet, I had billions of one certain shitcoin, but the value was at 0$. It must have been rugged some time ago while I didn't notice.

Also, in the late bull run, there were these projects that promised ridiculous staking rewards (like 2000% per year or even more) - for a example, TIME, OHM, etc. I got into one of them, but just like the rest, it collapsed too. 

My biggest loss is from UST after it depegged, in hindsight I should have sold it but I kept holding it since there were chances of it recovering. 

Thankfully I only invested a small amount of money into the riskiest projects, and it didn't take a long time to recover the losses. How about you? Any stories you wanna share?",1

What is the best way to purchase crypto with euros to minimize fees and maximize profits?,2023-12-22,1,0.53,"As a recent crypto buyer, I am confronted with several factors I didn't know about. 
I am using Kraken right now, not Kraken pro but standard version. When I went to make a purchase, firstly I was confronted to the fees, which were acceptable.

I learned that this is the spread. In this version of Kraken (mobile app), my only option seems to press ""buy"" crypto, then I am sent to a screen where I input the amount and then I am shown the new price of the BTC which I guess includes the spread.

I want to convert this to normal Vechain so I can send it to Coinbase account (for example).

Core and BTC,2023-12-26,0,0.29,"Core is helping Bitcoin to survive💪Don’t believe it? Let’s dive deeper👇

A possible scenario after the Blackrock ETF is that Blackrock accumulates and holds a large amount of Bitcoin. What looks like a good thing at first can turn into a nightmare. With Blackrock holding a large amount of Bitcoin, the BTC floating around in the market can disappear leaving the Bitcoin network with much less transactions. Without the percentage of transaction fees used to incentivize miners and the Bitcoin halving approaching, miners can stop mining Bitcoin for not being profitable enough to cover expenses.
By delegating hash power to Core Bitcoin miners get an extra source of rewards, which incentivizes them to keep mining Bitcoin - the first and most secure network ever.

More pro-bitcoin Politicians are being elected and   guiding their counties in to a pro-bitcoin era.

As we've seen in the recent Greyscale Vs SEC case, even the judicial system has come down in favor of BTC.

Today the reality we live was all but a distant fantastical dream to the Bitcoin Dev's and BitcoinTalk forum participants from over a decade ago.

Over the years Bitcoiners have been wrongly and disproportionately attacked by the financial media and governments labelled as scammers, Ponzi schemers, drug abusers, tax evaders etc etc 

Now these days the same institutions are more commonly found trying to profit from Bitcoin coverage or taxation!

Bitcoin world be nothing without the early developers, pioneers, risk takers and adopters. 

The other reality is that for future generations Bitcoin will never be anything without all of us here and now.

We have been gifted a moment in history to return decentralized empowerment to every individual and unite the world.

"Hypothetical scenario: I'd like to buy the world a coke, with crypto. Which should I use?",2023-12-22,149,0.76,"So, a little background. There was this 1970s commercial. It was famous for the older crowd. If you have no idea, somebody put it on YouTube (of course):   
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2msbfN81Gm0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2msbfN81Gm0)

This was impossible back in the 1970s. Is it still impossible today given the progress we've made in technology? 

Here's the destination for the money, the world's population: 

[https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)

How can we give an account to everyone and put enough money in for 1 Coca-Cola as a one-time thing? How could we do it if we wanted to keep doing it as an ongoing operation? 

Preemptively: 

1. Yes, this is goofy, a bit insane, and very silly. Your point? It's a great thought experiment on crypto scaling and testing whether conventional finance would do it better or whether crypto has matured enough that this use case demonstrates a nice, benign utility. 
2. Yes, you're going to have to put some accounts in escrow because your government sanctions certain individuals and nobody wants to go to jail over this. The list will vary depending on what country you're in. Assume that nobody doing this wants to break the law and thus you should include a good faith effort to comply with legal requirements. 
3. If you hate Coca-Cola for whatever reason, don't tell me. Feel free to provide a different product or even a service without the need to seek permission. I don't care. 
4. Yes, Coca-Cola would have to cooperate with this. The less work they would need to do, the better for the purpose of the scenario. Making one account under Coca-Cola's control and have them manage the hard parts is cheating. Since they're ok with playing around with NFTs (as of 2021), they are not going to be too hard a sell if they need only accept money and give out soda. ",1

>**Solana Developers Say Reason for Network Outage Still Unclear**  
“At approximately 05:46:16 UTC 2023-02-25, Solana Mainnet Beta suffered a significant performance degradation,” the developers said. “Eventually leading the validator community to opt for a restart of the network. The cause of this is still unknown and under active investigation.”  
“Root cause is still unknown and under active investigation,” developers added.  
The problems that started as sluggish transaction processing spiraled into a near complete shutdown of activity on Solana, validators and developers told CoinDesk over the weekend.

And what about that Mainnet **Beta?** Yes, you heard right, it's still only in Beta, even though they said over 2 years ago that it's ready for prime time, but they'd keep the '**Beta**' tag for a year or so:

>Mainnet is launched! It was launched in March and is successfully working. For your understanding - Yes, we were first calling it beta because it was just launched and not every function was available.  
***We will keep the suffix ""beta"" for a year or so because we want to check the mainnet stability in the long term and make sure we have a great product.*** But it's a working network - partners work on this network, Serum DEX running on this blockchain, KIN moves it's users to this network and that is exactly the blockchain the Solana Accelerator team winners use to build on.

Currently the main explorer still lists it as Beta. I invite you to check for yourself:

(a quick look at [https://solanabeach.io/validators](https://solanabeach.io/validators) should confirm)

This is a remarkably frightening statistic. This is definitely not decentralized enough, not even remotely so. Could you imagine if there was a Bitcoin mining pool that controlled 75% of the hashing power?

* **In-Kind**: People give you toys that are just like the ones in your box. In exchange, you give them a piece of your toy box. This way, the number of toys in your box stays the same.

So they actually wanted people to buy  BTC ETF shares with BTC?",1
Is Proof-of-Stake centralising?,2023-12-26,31,0.67,"Let me preface this by saying that I think decentralised finance is one of the greatest inventions in our lifetimes. To think that all the financial empires of the past few millennia struggled to find monetary media and stores of wealth that was incorruptible, salable, resistant to supply manipulation... and the closest that they ever got was gold... I find crypto exciting and the technology beautiful. I can't wait to see it play out over the next decade.

**The value of crypto over fiat is decentralisation.** Without decentralisation, crypto would be worthless. So any claims that a consensus mechanism is centralised is a cause for discussion.

I have rudimentary knowledge of how Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake works. In PoW, the network is secured by mining power. In PoS, the network is secured by locked validator funds. I cheered on the 2022 ETH PoW -> PoS merge, even baked lil ethereum-shaped cookies for it haha. To me ETH was just being decentralised in another way, because you would see the same dispersion of validators in a PoS system as you would see of miners in a PoW system. Sure, there would still be degrees of centralisation contingent on how some entities could possess more processing power or a larger stake, but this risk exists for both consensus mechanisms. 

However I'm reading a book called Broken Money now by Lyn Alden. She's very pro-bitcoin but argues that PoS blockchains are inherently centralising. 

The claims I can make out so far:

* **PoS requires trust, while BTC/PoW is trustless.** She cites both the Solana and BSC blockchain (both PoS) going offline several times during 22-23 (I'm surprised more people aren't concerned about this). Since there is no real-world cost (like committing electricity) to producing new blocks on PoS chains, anyone can create an alternative ledger of false transactions. She argues that the only way to proceed is for major stakers to get into a literal chatroom and decide where to restart a blockchain from - and so systems are dependent on centralised entities, usually those that hold the most wealth. 
* **The rich get richer faster, and increasingly possess more power in the system**. The nature of PoS is that staking more coins increases staking yields, which in turn increases the staked funds. This leads to an exponential increase in the share of the network. Theoretically, over time, power centralises to the wealthiest validators. 
* **PoS is inherently concentrating, with limited distributive capability**. For reasons stated in the dot point above

Could more tech-savvy weigh-in? How legit are these claims? Is the degree of potential centralisation worrying? Or negligible? Serious answers only, leave the shitposts at the door

So far I haven't seen any problems with how Eth is running (I'm so pro-eth it's not funny) but I wonder if these problems are more salient in smaller PoS blockhains.

"My plan for capitalising bitcoin ETF, please give me your thoughts",2023-12-25,37,0.68,"EDIT - You know what? You guys changed my mind. I'm just going to spot something with the money instead. Thanks for the feedback 


My assumption is that once the ETF is approved, bitcoin will spike. I want to capitalise on this by placing a highly levered position on bitcoin the instance it's announced.

To do this, I have python code monitoring the SEC press releases, as well as multiple news outlet sources (using RSS, the announcement will come to me instantaneously) 

The code monitors mentions of 'bitcoin' and 'etf'. If they are mentioned, the code will pass the news to chatgpt, simply asking if the message says the ETF has been approved.

If chatgpt say yes, (technically returns a 1 instead of 0), my account will automatically place a highly leverage position, alert me and stop running. 

I've been running this for weeks with no false positives so far, however I can't forsee every possible pitfall. 

My only worry so far is the spread at the announcement Is so large that the leverage will wipe the account, however I'm relying on the speed of execution to get in before the market goes into a frenzy. Others have pointed out even the slightest negative impact will liquidate the account which is a consideration. My bet is there won't be any negative impact.

Course I want this plan to work, hence I'm only using 25x leverage, giving ~4% drawdown allowance which I assume should be more than enough. In reality I feel you could do it with 100x leverage however that seems to cut it too close in my opinion

"Cake Wallet displaying the correct address for a transfer, but the block explorer displaying a different unknown address",2023-12-22,4,0.64,"I tried to transfer some BCH to an exchange address, in which I used their QR code scan. I checked the address in Cake Wallet before sending which was correct. The transaction details within the app display the correct BCH address, which I checked after the transaction had a height of 20 blocks. The funds never arrived so I checked the block explorer link to find a different unknown recipient address. I'm unsure where this address came from and how to access it, however my funds are sitting within it.

Another strange thing is the sender address is different from the recipient address for my wallet in the Cake Wallet app. So honestly I really don't know what's going on. 

I'm not claiming anything malicious, would just like to resolve this issue.

EDIT:

Just for anyone that comes across this post, the outcome was that this was caused by a glitch in Cake Wallet reading the QR code from Kraken deposits for BCH. The Cake Wallet support was very helpful and actually refunded my BCH out of their own pocket.",1
Is there drag on leveraged perpetuals?,2023-12-23,0,0.3,"I know that leveraged ETFs aren’t good for long term investing because of compound interest & exponential decay. An example I found gives this example to demonstrate drag:


>Suppose we have the sleep ETF: ZZZ and the 3 X leveraged sleep ETF: XXXZZZ. They both start at $100 a share.
>
>Day 1: ZZZ +10% ($110) XXXZZZ +30% ($130)
>
>Day 2: ZZZ -20% ($88) XXXZZZ -60% ($52)
>
>Day 3: ZZZ +10% ($96.8) XXXZZZ +30% ($67.6)

Moon Governance is live on Snapshot,2023-12-19,80,0.82,"Hey everybody, we’re excited to announce that Moon governance is back via Snapshot! Snapshot is an off chain governance platform that will allow the community to continue to use Moons as a governance token for decisions pertaining to Moons and r/CryptoCurrency. For more info check out their [documentation.](https://docs.snapshot.org/introduction)  A few points to highlight:

* All Moon holders will be able to use their full token balances to vote
* **You will need to have joined the space prior to poll creation in order to vote, otherwise you will not be included in the snapshot. To join the space connect your wallet and click the blue “join” button and sign the propagated message**
* Voting is gasless as users will sign verifiable messages to vote
* Initial quorum will be 5,000,000 Moons, but is subject to change
* To avoid manipulation a snapshot of all balances is taken at the time of poll creation, so if you’d like to vote using a specific wallet your Moons will need to be in that wallet when the poll is created
* Governance proposals will still be discussed and proposed in r/CryptoCurrencyMeta before going to a formal vote  


There are three discussions currently ongoing in r/CryptoCurrencyMeta that will lead to formal governance polls on snapshot, please be sure to review these before voting!

All crypto lost during wallet transfer,2023-12-24,328,0.86,"I started purchasing crypto in May 2021. I stuck to ETH and BTC almost exclusively and started out on Binance.  After a short time I decided to move to BlockFi and transferred my assets there.

I held and purchased more over time in BlockFi.  Of course after FTX BlockFi went bankrupt.  After a year or so BlockFi let me withdraw from my Wallet into another Wallet. So I created a transfer in Binance on 11/21/23 - one for ETH and one for BTC.

I performed the transfers and got co formation from the BlockFi end.  But the coins never showed up in Binance. So I now have nothing in either my BlockFi nor my Binance wallet. Basically I lost 3.8 ETH and 0.5 BTC, after BlockFi took the transfer fee, but nothing ever showed up.

I know this is lost now. But what the hell happened? Does anyone have any insight? And do I have any recourse (I assume not)?  

This is so incredibly frustrating. It’s no wonder crypto is in a limbo and I see why some think it never will pick up. While this may by my own fault it really shouldn’t have been this difficult to make a transfer.

Thanks for reading and for any advice you can give me

Edit: follow-up -

After some very nice redditors helped me realize the addresses of the wallets were not Binance, I reached out to my son (who is away at the moment hence I hadn’t been able to speak to him earlier) and he reminded me we set up an account on Trust. I didn’t remember this as I had only used Binance and BlockFi on my own. But I was able to log in to Trust and confirm my transfers occurred.

So yes, totally my fault. Thanks for the kind ones out there who helped me quell my anxiety about this!  Lots of lessons learned.",-1

Is User Error Inevitable in Crypto? It’s Too Easy to Make Costly Mistakes,2023-12-22,55,0.82,"We often hear that it’s the user’s responsibility to keep their assets safe. However, even tech-savvy individuals struggle with the current interfaces. Currently even a simple error like misentering a wallet address can have devastating financial consequences without even a warning. and the constant threat of scams and malware only adds to the risk.

Are we unfairly expecting too much from users in terms of navigating these complex systems?

We need to focus on creating systems that are not only secure but also intuitive and user-friendly. The current state, where users are thrust into a high-stakes environment with minimal guidance, sounds scary. UX in crypto is maybe a necessity to prevent chaos and protect users.

Bitcoin ETF: What happens to the Alts,2023-12-24,248,0.79,"Everyone seems to be expecting a Bitcoin ETF decision in January, between the 5th and the 10th. My question is what happens to the Alts, in this case, everything except BTC, ETH, and the stablecoins.

I see a few different scenarios:

&#x200B;

* ETFs approved (starting date some time later) and BTC pumps (front running the start date), at least for a while. In this case, BTC sucks fiat value out of the ALTs, and the ALTs fall significantly.
* ETFs approved (starting date some time later) and BTC falls (sell the news event), again at least for a while. In this case, ALTs dump harder, because that is always the way it is.
* ETFs deferred. This is more difficult to call, but I cannot see how it would cause the ALTs to rise.
* ETFs denied. BTC price dumps hard (likely to recover later because it is just business as usual and too may people BTFD), ALTs dump even harder, again because that is always the way it is.

So it seems to me that either ALTs do nothing in response, or they fall: there is no scenario in which they pump.

If this is right, then I might be inclined to sell my ALTs (none of which are real s\*\*t coins, so I'd expect normal service to resume later) and buy back a little later? What do other people thing, I'd like to see other opinions.

Also, please ignore tax implications, these vary from place to place and we don't all live in the US-of-A :)

Land ownership, patents, academic certificates, research papers, supply chain data, financial transactions, movies/ video copyright, etc can all go into Blockchain, and it is going to be a game changer!! 

However my question is : 
1. Will banks and financial institutions ever use public Blockchain, instead of creating their own Blockchain? When JP Morgan is coming up with their own Onyx platform, it got me thinking ""Which bank will ever use these public Blockchains?"" 


2. Singapore had many Blockchain pioneers but when Government of Singapore had to implement one, they created OpenCerts . Will any  government ever use public Blockchains? 

3. Real valuation:
Last year, There was a time when Polygon was making 600$ a day in fees. It got me thinking why is Polygon valued at billions when it isn't providing a service/value worth 600$.


4. Unhealthy growth equation: 
Esp In a bull market, The whale pumps the price 2X 3X. When rewards are 3X, Everyone wants to stake. esp In Proof of Stake, More you stake more rewards you get. To stake more, you buy more. When you buy more, The price goes up. When price goes up, Everyone wants to stake and get token as a reward. Until this bubble crashes... 

5. Eventually crypto technology is defamed:
I came across Traders Joe Application in AVAX, and the rewards for liquidity pair staking was like 20-300%. 

When someone gets 20% USD interest by staking AVAX, They will certainly buy AVAX and stake. When they buy AVAX, the price goes up. When price goes up, they get more interest, and so on. This eventually becomes an exponential function.

I remember the same incident with Raydium application in Solana in 2021. 

Until something unexpected happens and it crashes like Celsius, or Terra Luna.


Lets discuss:

1. 
Where do you think the SOL, AVAX, ADA, ETH, etc are  heading in terms of sustainable real world utility (not swap, meme, farming applications)?

2. Any examples where government or private companies are using public Blockchain, and sustainably paying gas fees? 

3. Are there any  token that are growing sustainably, by preventing unhealthy exponential growth, and crashes that eventually defames the Blockchain technology? 

4. Anything we can do to prevent defamation of crypto technology?

Is anybody else seeing these Deep Fake sponsored ads on YouTube?,2023-12-27,213,0.92,"A majority of the time I click on a YouTube video pertaining to cryptocurrency, I’ll see an influential leader like Charles Hoskinson, the Brad Garlinghouse & now I’m seeing Michael Saylor and they’re all talking about (not really them. The image and the voices are incredibly realistic though) sending your coins to a QR code on screen and that they’ll give you double of whatever you send.
The main problem besides the misleading video is that you can’t even report it on YouTube. You can only click “stop seeing ad” and 3 vague reasons you don’t want to watch them like is it repetitive? Is it inappropriate or irrelevant and while I might not see the ad again myself, other unsuspecting retailer investors are at risk.
It’s a shame with the bull market just beginning that this negativity isn’t being curbed but allowed to continue on unmolested.
Is there anything we can do to stop these malicious advertisements and they seem to be sponsored as well.",-1
"Judge orders Craig Wright to pay over $1M, accepts new evidence over Satoshi’s identity",2023-12-24,687,0.95,"The legal battle over Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity and Bitcoin rights has taken another turn in recent days, with a British judge rescheduling the trial between Craig Wright and Bitcoin Core developers for Feb. 5.

In 2016, Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin (BTC), and sued 13 Bitcoin Core developers and a group of companies, including Blockstream, Coinbase, and Block, alleging violations of his copyright to Bitcoin's white paper, Bitcoin file format, and Bitcoin blockchain database. The group is represented in the case by the non-profit Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA).

Justice Mellor also granted the developers a second security application, ordering Wright to pay by Jan. 5 an additional 800,000 pounds (~$1 million) to cover the developers' legal costs in the event he loses the trial. Wright already deposited 100,000 pounds ($127,000) as a security payment.

In addition, the judge ordered Wright to pay 65,000 pounds ($82,000) to cover COPA’s costs for expert evidence related to his Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Wright claimed he has a disability due to ASD and produced a report outlining adjustments needed for him in the trial, including the list of all cross-examination questions. In cross-examination, the opposing party asks questions to clarify or discredit a witness' testimony.

Wright’s request was challenged by the developers, who hired an expert to support their claims. As a result, Wright will only be able to access LiveNote Screen and write questions on paper during the trial.

The Bitcoin code is open-sourced and freely distributed under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology license, allowing users to reuse it for any purpose, including proprietary applications. In his argument, Wright contends that Bitcoin Core developers are a “Bitcoin Partnership,” which is alleged to control Bitcoin.",1
Why does can I use Crypto for payments without losing everything to fees?,2023-12-25,0,0.37,"Edit: sorry for fucking up the title

I currently have two different coins and mainly use them for transferring money. I have Bitcoin and Tether (USDT). Both of them are a struggle to pay with, while bitcoin has high fees right now, Tether needs ETH for gas fees which are also high. Buying and transferring ETH from an exchange to my wallet to use as gas does cost even more fees, and takes a lot of time. 

All I want is an easy and not so costly transferring method. The shop where I spend my money does accept BTC, ETH, USDT and LTC. I am thinking about setting up LTC but I fear that it is a lot of work and will still cost a lot in fees anyways.

I think cryptocurrencies have a lot of potential, especially with bitcoin lightning network and stuff like that, but using crypto to transfer money is pretty shitty right now :(",-1
Where do you think we go from here?,2023-12-21,4,0.54,"SO here is a prediction that I would like to put on the record. Its just my opinion and not a financial advise so don't get too excited. I was expecting a reasonable 30-50% price correction for BTC and Alts between now and lets say 8 weeks. It would have been nice and healthy for the market to do so without a huge shock to the investors emotional state and I pray it still happens.

Unfortunately the prices are going ape shit and things might escalate from here. IF they do, BTC is going to around 50k, give or take few grand in next 8 weeks, based on the unreasonable mania that is starting to hit the crypto space. Alts will have what feels like an Alts season and have like we already see 20-50% price increases daily depending on a coin. It will feel like there is no stopping it and nothing but ATH for everyone are just weeks and months away.

Despite that feeling we will come down hard in next few months if things continue like they have been recently. Now that the market is starting to go ape shit and thinking we are on the way to ATHs sooner then before, I revise my prediction from reasonable dip and say we will have a larger correction of 50% BTC  and 70% for Alts as a result of the silliness we are witnessing already. Despite the believe that ETFs will change everything, they won't over night and definitely not in first few months of 2024. My only hope from here is that the Holiday Season will slow things down and give us the more reasonable dip I'm hoping for, but if not, the pain is on its way and people will loose their shit.

After the dust clears we will have a great bull run continuation but the effects of the dip will leave a mark and some with PTSD.

Edit: Since many of you say 30-50% is a crazy large dip for BTC on the way up to new ATHs and it can't happen because of some Retracement Fib that you see on your Technical Analysis lets take a closer look at history.

Here are examples of corrections that prove I know what I'm talking about. All of those are only on the way up so none included declines into crypto winter that tend to be 50% plus all the way down and do not include the many others between 15-25%.

Mar 10, 2015 - 28.3%

July 12, 2015 - 37.5%

Nov 4, 2015 - 41.5%

Jun 18, 2016 - 39.1%

Jan 5, 2017 - 37.9%

Mar 10, 2017 - 34.5%

Jun 12, 2017 - 41.5%

Sep 1, 2017 - 40.1%

Nov 8, 2017 - 30.5%

Jun 26, 2019 - 53.6%

Feb 13, 2020 - 63.4% Pandemic

Jan 8, 2021 - 32.1%

Apr 14, 2021 - 55.9%

So notice how much they like to happen in first 4 months of the year especially in Jan and March. Sometimes even two times in that 4 month period like Jan and Mar of 2017 and Jan and Apr of 2021. Also notice if they happen regularly like quarterly they tend do be no more then 40% but if they have longer period they tend to be over 50%. The last one of such magnitude was on the way to ATH in 2021 bull market. We have not had any of them as of yet in this bull run and with BTC price currently at 65% of previous ATH we are now overdue for one and that one would be 30% to over 50% right on schedule. None of them stop or derail the bull runs, they just rebalance the shorts and longs and shake out the weak hands as they supposed to, so they are considered healthy.

Also if BTC has a 50% dip the Alts tend to have 70% plus dip. Just check out the Jun 26th in 2019, BTC wend down 53% and ETH, ADA, Link and the rest dipped over 70%. That is why the 50-70% dip projection the longer we go without one. BTC is going down minimum to 31k no matter how high it gets in price from this point on. That means it will take 30% now or much higher later, depending on the price BTC gets before the hit. ",1

Taxes and Issues with Crypto Exchanges,2023-12-24,6,0.66,"Many people cannot login to their accounts despite having gone through verification and contacting customer support. For example at Coinbase there are many people who just go through a known ongoing verification loop. **Check with your accountant**, but it seems to many experts that it would be reasonable to consider this as a capital loss for tax purposes.

**This would be a reduction in your taxable income.**

There is Federal law and State law and there are probably limits, the limits can probably be carried forward. The point is that if your money is in the account, but the exchange is not letting you access it then **there is a reasonable argument that the exchange has liquidity issues** since this has happened before. It would make sense that the tax treatment would be the same.

TL;DR If your access to your account has been blocked, you have followed proper protocol and you are being given the runaround, don't assume that it's stolen. Ask your accountant and find out about taking a tax loss because this makes sense. Caveat, if you ever do get your money back then that might be a tax gain. You may want to send the exchange an email and a letter telling them the time and date of when you would have cashed out and in what amount. Again check with your accountant.

The question is, what was the tax treatment for people who lost money in failed exchanges?",-1

Listings on Binance,2023-12-27,2,1.0,"Hi guys  

Genuine question from a rookie.  
 

Despite all the crypto green, I have been struggling a bit lately and this situation is just grinding my gears. I've noticed this thing happening every time a new coin gets listed on Binance lately – it shoots up by thousands of percentages in milliseconds. BONK, ACE and NFP are the latest in this scenario.

What's the deal? Are there tradebots grabbing these coins the moment they drop, or is it really just the staked amount from the launchpool the week before launch that is hitting the market? Seriously, even if you try to snag some within the first 2 seconds, you're already way too late and prices start dropping only minutes after launch.

Is there any way for a retail investor, like myself, to get some profit out of this situation? Like, is there a tool I can use? Or is the only thing I can do trying to stake it beforehand in the launchpool?

What do you all think of new currencies?,2023-12-26,0,0.32,"I've recently delved into the crypto space and found myself intrigued by some high-risk coins. Specifically, I've been exploring KAS, VAX, BDP, and VAI. While the allure of potential high returns is tempting, it's crucial to approach such investments judiciously. Each of these coins operates within its distinct ecosystem and carries its set of challenges and opportunities. For instance, KAS might be leveraging innovative technology, VAX could be influenced by specific market sentiments or strategic partnerships, BDP might be paving the way in decentralized finance solutions, and VAI could be associated with stablecoin functionalities. As I navigate this landscape, I'm diligently researching each coin's whitepapers, assessing team credentials, gauging community sentiment, and evaluating potential use cases. However, it's vital to remember the volatile nature of these investments. While they offer growth potential, they equally present risks.

Telcoin Wallet Hack?,2023-12-26,11,0.73,"I was looking at the charts and saw a nearly 50 percent price drop. Was it a whale selling their coins or a potential wallet hack?

Or is this the beginning of a rug pull? From my understanding this coin has been around nearly 5 years or so now and was wondering if people have seen drops like this with other 5+ year coins? 

If it is a hack can someone with knowledge explain the vulnerabilities on how something like this can happen in the first place?

Secondly, what can be put in place to prevent things like this happening in the first place.

Bull case for Kadena (Kda),2023-12-25,0,0.43,"Kadena had its first big candle since the bear market as one of the top movers for the day.

This project has been a hidden gem the last 2 years. Nobody has really talked about it which is fine by me. It had an ungodly parabolic, hype driven move at the end of the last cycle and broke the top 100 by market cap without a major exchange (it was on kucoin but that was as ""big"" as it got)Since then it was just in a downtrend but I've kept a close watch on what's being done on the chain.

The reason being is that it's a fundamental power house of a project.

The project was started by Stuart Popejoy and William Martino who created JP Morgan’s first blockchain and led the SEC’s Crypto Committee respectively. They built JPmorgans first crypto network.That's 2 leaders who know how to navigate the traditional financial and regulatory world ensuring everything has been done by the book. They're also brilliant programmers and there a lot of interviews available.

On their advisory team is Dr. Stuart Haber, he was the most cited author in Satoshis bitcoin white paper. Reason being, is that he is the literal inventor of blockchain. There would be no bitcoin without him.

Pact: Pact is the Kadena programming language that was built from the ground up with cryptography in mind. There's a lot of limitations being put on the devs of all these other layer 1s by sticking with Solidity, Python, c++ and older traditional coding languages. Other blockchain devs are trying to build pyramids with stone age tools. You might be able to get the structure up but will it survive the test of time and all the elements? You shouldn't have to put all these band aid layer 2s on top of a solid foundation. Fixed pipes leak eventually 

By using pact the result is a green POW(as secure and decentralized as BTC) layer 1that scales indefinitely. Kadena uses layers of webbed sidechains to ensure the fastest most efficient route to instant finality. There will never be the issue that Avax ( I hold and use avax so don't think I'm just shitting on it for fud sake,I like it, just an example) has right now with insane gas fees that exceed the cost of the transaction.

The tech and the team are absolutely impressive. They've essentially solved the crypto trilema and it blows my mind nobody talks about it. Look into it. I could rant more about it but I know CC is usually more interested in pumpamentals over any DD or fundamentals

Pumpamentals: The market cap as of writing this is 378.91m and it stands at 137 of all crypto. This is of course after the 68% pump of the day. Its still such a small cap coin. Its ATH was 28.21 in April of 2021. It's still down 95% from there but I believe it can easily go far beyond it this cycle. Easily. SOL still has a lot of legs left in this cycle and it's market cap is at 48.43b. AVAX is at 17.43b. These market caps could easily be obtained and exceeded by a layer 1 as strong and competent as KDA

They're supported on more exchanges this cycle ( binance, okx, gate.io and still kucoin for non us resident), they recently got ledger support, have more exchanges in mind (coinbase was filed)and they're starting a marketing campaign in January. Layer 1s have been going absolutely insane as of late. Sectors pump in tandem. KDA will follow and it's still under so many peoples radars and actually has transparent team and utility to retail and most importantly, the institutions which will be driving these markets after ETF news.

I could also go into some TA reasons to be bullish but don't want to piss you guys off anymore than I have. Atleast look at the weekly chart if that's your thing.",1

AI Trading,2023-12-24,0,0.36,"I have tried the platforms and exchanges that offer trading bots. They have always lost. Especially long term. I've honestly never been impressed

This is why I've been working on my own AI assistants to trade for me. I'm building them and honestly wonder what people think about this. I find it to have huge potential.

Here is my approach:
Build an AI assistant to build and code strategies from documents and videos. 
Then the next assistant debugs the output.
Stage 3 is where another AI will backtest the strategy, while outputting the data to a spreadsheet.
AI assistant number 4 will take the highest performing strategy that has been back tested, and take trades for me.

I am documenting this for future intentions. Also really curious how much someone would pay for such a service? For AI to build, debug, test and complete trades. 24/7.

NY Bankruptcy of Genesis Vote,2023-12-27,0,0.5,"Curious what people’s perspective is in this subreddit for the loan program Gemini had with Genesis. I chose to vote no as I believe the people with far more money deserve the chance to recover more. The current bankruptcy plan would settle with BTC at a price of like $12k when it was at 18-20k when the scam went down. Just doesn’t sit right that some people may have bought in when I did and are missing out on close to 300% returns. I just put some shits and giggles amounts in that I could afford to lose and EASILY lose. I know a lot of others weren’t so lucky.

More specifically, I saw to borrow Genesis had to offer some absurd amount of future shares as collateral from cryptocurrency ETFs. I think they seek to be getting away from way more creditors. Don’t quote me on this, but I believe like 95% of their creditors come from the 300,000 people scammed by the earn function. Further, apparently there’s evidence Gemini knew or should’ve known Genesis was defunct? This situation is kinda nuts.

Whether or not you’re a part of the class, what do you think the best outcome is and why?",1
Small investments and wallet network fee (Newbie),2023-12-26,5,0.64,"I decided to stop holding my crypto on binance and instead finally use software wallet. I created one on Exodus and was ready to send there my BTC. I just found out that every transfer has a 0.0004BTC (17$) fee.

I mean, I am okay with paying it now because i want to send all my BTC to the wallet. But let's say I want to invest 20$ every week to BTC. So in order to always hold my BTC on Exodus, that would mean i have to pay 0.0004BTC (17$) fee every transfer from Binance to Exodus. So by investing 20$ to BTC i will lose 17$ just by sending it to wallet.

Thats obviously non-sense to do.

So how do you do it? Do you buy the crypto, hold it on exchange such as Binance, Coinbase and after you hit a certain amount of $ you send it into wallet?",1
Someone explain this one to me,2023-12-26,0,0.33,Crypto dot com is absolutely rediculous so on the 23 and 24 of December I bought unibot the price on there app claimed unibot traded around 70 dollars. My average price is 69 dollars canadian saying I'm up 23$ currently s9 17%ish. I looked on coin market cap and the price is actually 69$ so they sold me it at there price listed but when u go to sell on the conformation screen it says 56$ . So I'm up 17% yet the end trade screen shows if I sold now I would lose 32 % . For 111 when my cost was 138. How does this make any sense.,-1
Next Trend Leading To The 2024 Bull Market?,2023-12-26,207,0.88,"So what's your opinion on the next trend in the crypto space which will catapult new crypto highs? Previously during every bull market beginning we had a fundraising trend which saw quick profit opportunities.

In 2013-2016 we had Pre mined coins - Litecoin, Dogecoin etc came from these

In 2016 - 2018 we had ICOs - Ethereum, came from this

In 2018 - 2019 We had IEOs launched by Binance, and then launched by everyone else. Many current projects came from this

In 2019 - 2021 we had IDOs fueling DeFi and GameFi

What will be the next token trend? Many people say it probably will be the tokenization of RWA but not sure",1
Altcoins are my way to escape poverty,2023-12-26,279,0.67," 

When  you live in a poor country with high inflation you cannot escape  poverty that easily. The big profits lies in the altcoins. In the pre-halving  years, it was the best time to accumulate and buy more coins. So stacking more and more altcoins are the best way to prepare for a  bullrun.

Back in 2021 I heard so  many people telling me that they wished to buy more coins and wished for lower prices. Now the valuation of all altcoins are so low, they are so  undervalued.

Can altcoins still do a -50%? Yes, of course, they can do even worse!

But NOBODY can predict the exact bottom! If you don't start to invest, you won't be making gains in a bullrun!

We live in a time where the gap between the poor and rich are growing bigger. Inflation rises..look here:

In the United States

&#x200B;

|*average:*|1971|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Household income | *$10k* | **$70k** |
| car price | *$5k* | **$42k** |
| Housing price | *$30k* | **$484k** |
| college | *$400* | **$9300** |

Household income doesn't rise as much as price of all those things! For the years to come, inflation will hit the whole world even harder.

Imagine  the same, but in a poor country with high inflation and now we can see  that the only way to escape this is the new asset created to fight this:
